# The-Blood-Evaluation-program
The program will instruct users to enter their personal information and will allow users to enter their blood test (Complete Blood Count, Basic Metabolic Panel, Vitamins) results. The patient's personal information as well as the values of the blood test result will be stored in a database file. Upon conditional analysis with predefined values the program will then tell users what symptoms patients can feel if they have a deficiency or intoxication in that specific component. With the help of the aforementioned analysis, the program will evaluate the disease and recommend suitable medications for the patient and prompt the possible time duration during which the disease or symptom might disappear.
